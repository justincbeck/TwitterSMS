WillowTree Test

This is my test project for application to WillowTree Apps.

To use this project you must clone it and then initialize it's submodules as follows:

1) git submodule init
2) git submodule update
3) git submodule foreach git checkout master

After these steps have been taken, the project should build and run correctly.
